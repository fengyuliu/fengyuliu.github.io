Welcome to my personal website!

I'm Fengyu Liu, a fourth-year PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, supervised by Prof. [Yanne K. Chembo](https://chembolab.umd.edu/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from School of Physics, Nankai University in 2019. 

My work and research experience
======
I have broad interests in nonlinear photonics, quantum photonics, stochastic analysis, machine learning, etc. In my current research, I study the quantum and semi-classical dynamics of the photon interation in optical whispering gallery mode (WGM) microresonators, use computational methods to simulate electromagnetic field distributions and evolutions in various optical systems, explore the effects of different kinds of fluctuations, and develop methods to eliminate the phase noise caused by them. In the past, I have also participated in different research projects (e.g., Photonic crystals and metamaterials) at Nankai University and Cornell University.
I'm a reviewer of Optik (Elsevier) and Optical Engineering (SPIE).
