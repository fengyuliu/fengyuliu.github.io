Welcome to my personal website!

I'm Fengyu Liu. I received the B.S. degree in physics from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, in 2019, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, in 2024, supervised by Prof. [Yanne K. Chembo](https://chembolab.umd.edu/).

My work and research experience
======
I have broad interests in nonlinear photonics, quantum photonics, stochastic analysis, machine learning, etc. My current research involves nonlinear and quantum photonic systems, with a focus on high-Q microresonator technology. In the past, I have also participated in different research projects (e.g., Photonic crystals and metamaterials) at Nankai University and Cornell University.
I'm a reviewer of many scientific journals including JSTQE (IEEE), Physical Review Research/A/E (APS), Optics Letters/Express (Optica), etc.
