ABSTRACT: 
Kerr optical frequency combs are expected to play a major role in photonic technology, with applications related to spectroscopy, sensing, aerospace, and communication engineering. Most of these applications are related to the metrological performance of Kerr combs, which is ultimately limited by their noise-driven fluctuations. For this reason, it is of high importance to understand the influence of random noise on the comb dynamics. In this communication, we theoretically investigate a model where Gaussian white noise is added to the coupled-mode equations governing the comb dynamics. This stochastic model allows us to characterize the noise-induced broadening of the spectral lines. Moreover, this study permits to determine the phase noise spectra of the microwaves generated via comb photodetection. In this latter case, our analysis indicates that the low-frequency part of the spectra is dominated by pattern drift while the high-frequency part is dominated by pattern deformation. The theoretical results are found to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.
