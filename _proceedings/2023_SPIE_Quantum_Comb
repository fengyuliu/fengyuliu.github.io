ABSTRACT: 
Quantum Kerr optical frequency combs are generated by pumping a high-Q microresonator with a continuous-wave resonant laser. Below threshold, two pump photons are symmetrically up- and down-converted as twin-photons via spontaneous four-wave mixing, thereby generating up to a hundred paired channels. These chipscale, high-dimensional and room-temperature systems are expected to play a major role in quantum engineering. However, their theoretical description is still unclear. Here, we present an explicit description of this quantum system via a frequency-bin state and its density operator, and explore the properties of the eigenkets.
