ABSTRACT: 
A key application of Kerr optical frequency combs is ultrapure microwave generation. In this case, the intermodal radiofrequency of the comb is retrieved via photodetection. The three main challenges for the study of phase noise spectra are the determination of the various sources of noise, the understanding of how these stochastic excitations lead to microwave phase fluctuations, and finally the determination of the phase noise spectra from the nonlinear phase fluctuations. In this communication, we present our latest results and demonstrate that the phase noise spectra have two dominant contributions that can be determined separately.
