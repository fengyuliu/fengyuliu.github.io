ABSTRACT: 
Optical microresonators have the capability to trap laser light by total internal reflection for a duration higher than a microsecond. In these ultra-high Q optical cavities, the small volume of confinement, high photon density and long photon lifetime ensures a strong light-matter interaction, which can trigger various effects mediated by optical nonlinearities. In this communication, we report some of the latest advances related to the understanding of stochastic and quantum phenomena in optical microresonators, and we relate them as well to some of the main applications in photonic engineering.
