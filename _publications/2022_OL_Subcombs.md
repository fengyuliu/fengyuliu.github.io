ABSTRACT: 
We report experimental observation of subharmonic mode excitation in primary Kerr optical frequency combs generated using crystalline whispering-gallery mode resonators. We show that the subcombs can be controlled and span a single or multiple free-spectral ranges around the primary comb modes. In the spatial domain, the resulting multiscale combs correspond to an amplitude modulation of intracavity roll patterns. We perform a theoretical analysis based on eigenvalue decomposition that evidences the mechanism leading to the excitation of these combs.
